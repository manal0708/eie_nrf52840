git commit # records snapshot of work
git branch # branch off of main code; allows edits without changing main code
git checkout # allows you to switch btwn branches
git pull # pulls from remote to local and combines with merge
git push # pushes from local to remote
    -> note: -u <remote> <branch> is needed the first time you push to a branch
    as it tells github to make this branch on the remote 
git merge # takes change from source branch and combines into target branch; two parents
git rebase # no merge; rewrites to main; doesn't preserve entire history
git fetch # retrieves from remote but no merging
git add # adds file to "staging area"
git status # tells you status of files i.e. whether added or not
git log # shows you Git history "tree" w/ newest commit at top
git diff # tells you the difference in the old and new files e.g. what text has been added

General Git Workflow
1. checkout main branch
2. pull remote changes to local repo to ensure main branch is up-to-date
3. create a lesson# branch for each lesson
4. do all the work for that lesson on that branch; create commits when achieving goals and milestones
5. at the end of a lesson, push lesson# to github
6. experiment and try to figure things out

Some notes:
- Checking out a different branch will make the files in that branch disappear on VS code as well i.e. you will need
to go back to that branch to see those files again
- Making lesson3 branch and checking it out, for example, means I can't see git.cheatsheet.txt anymore
- Always save in VS code before committing, otherwise nothing will change
- Generally procedure is: git add (adds modified file to "stage") -> git commit to take screenshot w/ message -> git push to push to remote
